# Android-Data-Extractor
A Simple FrameWork to Extract Data from android devices.
Android Data Extractor is the proposed system with a collection of forensic tools for smartphones. 
It performs read-only, forensically sound, non-destructive acquisition from Android devices. It has 
features, such as powerful Lock screen cracking for Pattern, PIN code, or Password; custom 
decoders for Apps data from Android & Windows databases for decoding communications. 
Extraction and decoders produce reports in HTML and Excel formats.

# FEATURES:

• Automated data extraction and decoding.

• Data extraction of non-rooted without devices by Android Backup (Android versions 4.x, 
varied/limited support).

• Data extraction with root permissions: root ADB daemon, CWM recovery mode, or SU 
binary (Superuser/SuperSU).

• Data parsing and decoding for Folder structure, Tarball files (from android backups), and 
Android Backup (backup.ab files).

• Selection of individual database decoders for Android apps.

• Decryption of encrypted WhatsApp archived databases (.crypt to .crypt12, must have the 
right key file).

• Lockscreen cracking for Pattern, PIN, Password (not gatekeeper).

• Unpacking the Android backup files.

• Screen capture of a device's display screen.
